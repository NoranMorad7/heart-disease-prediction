# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project is reimplementation to "Comprehensive evaluation and performance analysis of machine learning in heart disease prediction" paper it implements machine learning techniques to predict heart disease. It includes feature selection, feature extraction, and classification, along with AEHOM optimization.

## **Project Overview**
Heart disease is a leading cause of death globally, and early prediction can save lives. This project uses machine learning to predict heart disease by leveraging techniques like Genetic Algorithm, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), and AEHOM optimization for feature selection and hyperparameter tuning.

## **Project Structure**
- `Data/`: Contains the dataset used for analysis and training.
- `feature_selection.py`: Implements Genetic Algorithm and RFE for feature selection.
- `feature_extraction.py`: Includes feature extraction techniques for engineered features.
- `classification.py`: Code for classifying heart disease using MLDCNN.
- `aehom_optimization.py`: Implements AEHOM optimization for hyperparameter tuning.
- `Main.py`: Integrates all components for a streamlined execution pipeline.
